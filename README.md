# VHDL: Unexpected Behavior Due to Uninitialized Internal Signals

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in VHDL code: incorrect initialization of internal signals.

The `bug.vhdl` file contains a simple VHDL entity that registers an 8-bit input and outputs the registered value. However, the internal signal `internal_data` is initialized to "x", which represents an uninitialized state. Depending on the simulator, this can result in random values at the beginning of the simulation leading to incorrect outputs and making debugging more difficult.

The `bugSolution.vhdl` file shows the corrected code where the `internal_data` signal is explicitly initialized to a known value (e.g., 0). This ensures predictable and consistent behavior.

This example highlights the importance of properly initializing all signals in VHDL to avoid unexpected behavior and potential race conditions.
